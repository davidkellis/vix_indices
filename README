vix_indices
===========

An implementation of the VIX Indices as documented at 
http://www.spindices.com/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-vix-future-index.pdf

As of Aug. 17 2014, only the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index TR (SPVXSTR)
is implemented. I plan on implementing other indices later, but it's not a
priority.

Please note that the cumulative error in the computation of the indices grows
very quickly.

If a given index is calculated for just a single day given the
previous day's officially computed index level, this script's computed index 
level for the subsequent day is very close to the official index level.


How to use:

1. Make sure you have ruby 2.1 installed.
2. Run the download_data.rb script to download the latest VIX futures data
   from http://cfe.cboe.com/products/historicalvix.aspx and the latest 
   13-week Treasury Bill discount rates from www.treasurydirect.gov (see
   http://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult_query.htm).
3. Run the build_indices.rb script to compute the values of the indices from
   inception to today.


Notes:

The data directory contains the downloaded historical VIX futures data and the
historical 13-week Treasury Bill discount rates.
